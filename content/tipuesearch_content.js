TCP/IP specifies how data should be grouped, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination address. The TCP/IP model, along with many of its protocols, is maintained and managed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). \n TCP / IP提供數據的端到端連接。 TCP / IP指定如何在目標地址處對數據進行分組，尋址，傳輸，路由和接收。 TCP / IP模型及其許多協議由IETF（Internet工程任務組）維護和管理。 \n TCP/IP is one of two sets of protocols that collectively operate in the transport and network layers of the OSI model. \n TCP / IP是在OSI模型的傳輸層和網絡層中共同運行的兩組協議之一。 \n \n OSI Model.

As we discussed in previous modules, switches make their intelligent switching decisions (see the data link layer in the diagram above based on media access control (MAC) addresses. The MAC address, also known as the physical address, is the unique identifier hard coded on a network interface card by the manufacturer. Switches use these MAC addresses to identify which devices are on which switch ports, and forward traffic within the network segment to the correct ports based on these addresses. When data traffic needs to cross the boundaries of the network, it requires a logical address that the router can use to make intelligent routing decisions. In most modern networks, this is done by using TCP/IP addressing. Historically, other protocols existed, such as internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX) for Novell networks, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI for Microsoft networks. TCP/IP replaced these protocols almost exclusively due to its robust nature, reliability, and availability. \n 將數據從一個網段移動到另一個網段時，網絡設備需要邏輯地址-IPv4或IPv6地址（請參見上圖中的網 絡層）。正如我們在之前的模塊中討論的那樣，交換機做出明智的交換決策（請參見上圖中的數據鏈路 層，基於媒體訪問控制（MAC）地址。MAC地址，也稱為物理地址，是唯一的硬編碼標識符）交換機使用這 些MAC地址來識別哪些設備在哪個交換機端口上，然後根據這些地址將網段內的流量轉發到正確的端口。 網絡中，它需要路由器可以用來做出智能路由決策的邏輯地址。在大多數現代網絡中，這是通過使用 TCP / IP尋址來完成的。 / SPX）（用於Novell網絡，AppleTalk和用於Microsoft網絡的NetBEUI） ，TCP / IP幾乎完全由於其魯棒性，可靠性和可用性而取代了這些協議。不可靠。 \n While the majority of our networks today still use IPv4, many networks are migrating to the newer IPv6 addressing standards. Additionally, many networks are offering dual support to both IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition. The reason for this transition is that we were running out of valid IPv4 addresses. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, providing only 4.2 billion available addresses, but IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme. IPv6 allows for 2 128 addresses, or 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.4 x 10 38 ) unique IP addresses. IPv6 allows for more IP addresses than humanity could ever utilize.

The maximum value for any octet is 255 (2 8 -1) so therefore the maximum number of IPv4 addresses available is 2 32 , which equals 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. \n 每個八位位組由八位組成（一個字節或兩個半字節）。乘以四個八位位組，等於32位。任何八位位組的最大值為255 （28-1），因此，可用的IPv4地址的最大數量為232，等於4,294,967,296個唯一地址。 \n The presence of the subnet mask tells networking devices how much of the IP address belongs to the network and how much to the host. The 255.255.255.0 subnet represents that the first three octets are the network and the “0” represents the available number of hosts (nodes). So, the form is N.N.N.H. Think of the combination of IP and subnet as similar to regular postal addresses. You need a zip code (subnet) and street address (host). \n 子網掩碼的存在告訴網絡設備多少IP地址屬於網絡，多少屬於主機。 255.255.255.0子網表示前三個八位位組是網絡，“ 0”表示可用的主機（節點）數。因此，表格為N.N.N.H.可以將IP和子網的組合視為類似於常規郵政地址。您需要一個郵政編碼（子網）和街道地址（主機）。 \n There are five different classes in IPv4 labelled A through E, with classes A, B, and C used by computer networks and classes D and E reserved as experimental. As originally designed, the IP range is determined by the lead bits in the first octet and matched to one specific subnet mask. This is called "classful" addressing. When the IP class does not match the default subnet mask, it is called "classless." \n IPv4中有五種不同的類別，標記為A到E，計算機網絡使用的類別為A，B和C，D和E的類別保留為實驗用。按照最初的設計，IP範圍由第一個八位位組中的前導位確定，並與一個特定的子網掩碼匹配。這稱為“有類”尋址。如果IP類與默認子網掩碼不匹配，則稱為“無類”。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Addressing Notation 尋址符號.html'}, {'title': 'Network and Host Addresses\xa0網絡和主機地址', 'text': 'An IPv4 network address is further divided into two portions based upon the subnet mask: the network portion and the host portion. A subnet mask is a series of numbers used for routing traffic within a subnetwork. When a subnet mask is used to define the network portion, anywhere there is a binary “11111111” (or 255 in decimal) used, this area is considered part of the network portion. When a binary “00000000” (0 in decimal) is used, this represents the host portion of the address. The host represents a single device on the network, such as your computer or phone. \n IPv4網絡地址根據子網掩碼進一步分為兩部分：網絡部分和主機部分。子網掩碼是用於在子網內路由流量的一系列數字。當使用子網掩碼定義網絡部分時，在任何使用二進制“ 11111111”（或十進制255）的地方，該區域均被視為網絡部分的一部分。當使用二進制“ 00000000”（十進制為0）時，它表示地址的主機部分。主機代表網絡上的單個設備，例如您的計算機或電話。 \n The following two tables show the network and host portions of IP addresses. \n 以下兩個表顯示了IP地址的網絡部分和主機部分。 \n \n \n \n IP address (in decimal) \n 10 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n \n \n IP address (in binary) \n 00001010 \n 00000001 \n 00000010 \n 00000011 \n \n \n Subnet mask (in decimal) \n 255 \n 0 \n 0 \n 0 \n \n \n Subnet mask (in binary) \n 11111111 \n 00000000 \n 00000000 \n 00000000 \n \n \n \n Network bits \n Host bits \n Host bits \n Host bits \n \n \n \n \n In the example above, we see that our IP address is 10.1.2.3, and it has a class A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. (We will discuss subnet classes in more detail later in this module). If this subnet mask is converted to binary, we see is written as eight 1s, followed by 24 0s, giving us 255.0.0.0 in decimal notation. Therefore, wherever we see a 255 in a subnet mask, we know we are seeing the network portion defined. So, for this example, our specific host is 10.1.2.3 and our network address would be 10.0.0.0. \n 在上面的示例中，我們看到我們的IP地址為10.1.2.3，它的A類子網掩碼為255.0.0.0。 （在本模塊的後面，我們將 更詳細地討論子網類）。如果將此子網掩碼轉換為二進制，我們將看到它寫成八個1，然後是24 0，十進製表示為255 .0.0.0。因此，無論何時在子網掩碼中看到255，我們都知道看到了定義的網絡部分。因此，對於此示例，我們的特 定主機為10.1.2.3，我們的網絡地址為10.0.0.0。 \n \n E XAMPLE\xa0 \n 例子 \n \n \n If a network has an IP address of 192.168.1.2, and the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, we can identify the network and host portions of both addresses. To determine the network portion of the IP address, examine the subnet mask for which octets hold the value 255. In this case, the subnet mask has 255 in the first, second, and third octet. This means that the network portion of the IP address is the first, second, and third octet, as shown in the chart below. The remaining octet (the fourth octet) is the host portion of the address. \n 如果網絡的IP地址為192.168.1.2，子網掩碼為255.255.255.0，我們可以識別這兩個地址的網絡和主機部分。 要確定IP地址的網絡部分，請檢查其八位位組的子網掩碼為255的子網掩碼。在這種情況下，該子網掩碼在第一個， 第二個和第三個八位位組中具有255。這意味著IP地址的網絡部分是第一個，第二個和第三個八位位組，如下圖所示 。剩餘的八位位組（第四個八位位組）是地址的主機部分。 \n \n \n \n \n Network Portion \n Host Portion \n \n \n IP Address: 192.168.1.2 \n 192.168.1 \n 2 \n \n \n Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 \n 255.255.255 \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Network and Host Addresses\xa0網絡和主機地址.html'}, {'title': 'IPv4 Address Classes IPv4地址類別', 'text': 'As you can see, when the subnet mask has a 255 in it, it is defining the network portion of the address.

A standard class A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 is used for all networks where the first octet starts with a number between 1 and 126.

In this course, we only deal with “classful” subnet masks — the ones that only contain values of 255 and 0.

There is also a special address called the loopback address, which is 127.0.0.1. The entire range of 127.x.x.x is reserved to support this loopback address. A loopback address is an IP reserved to reference the computer on which you are currently working. Every computer knows to answer up for itself when a reference to 127.0.0.1 is given. This is also known as as the “localhost.” \n 如您在地址類別表中看到的，類別A引用第一個八位位組的值是1-126的網絡，類別B引用128-191，類別C引用192-223。 還有一個稱為回送地址的特殊地址，即127.0.0.1。 保留127.x.x.x的整個範圍以支持此環回地址。 回送地址是保留的IP，用於引用您當前正在使用的計算機。 當給出對127.0.0.1的引用時，每台計算機都知道會自己回答。 這也稱為“本地主機”。 \n To route your traffic over the Internet, you are required to have a publically routable IP address. These addresses are globally managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). If you desire to have one of these addresses, you must purchase them for use to ensure no one else has that specific number. For most users, this is done for you by your Internet service provider (ISP), but if you have a need for numerous public IP addresses, you can buy a block of them from ICANN. \n 要通過Internet路由流量，您需要具有可公開路由的IP地址。 這些地址由互聯網名稱與數字地址分配機構（ICANN）全局管理。 如果您希望擁有這些地址之一，則必須購買它們以確保沒有其他人擁有該特定號碼。 對於大多數用戶而言，這是由Internet服務提供商（ISP）為您完成的，但是如果您需要大量的公共IP地址，則可以從ICANN購買其中的一部分。 \n Private IP addresses, on the other hand, can be used by anyone without any prior coordination. This is because private IP addresses are not routable over the Internet and are only used inside your local area network. For example, at your home, you may have five computers hooked up to your switch and those machines are all using private IP addresses. When you make a request to go outside the network, like to visit a college’s website, your router performs a network address translation (NAT) that allows your private IP address to be converted into a public IP address and a port, which then makes the request on your behalf. There is a specific range of IP addresses that are reserved as private for internal use (by you and others). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 另一方面，任何人都可以使用私有IP地址，而無需事先協調。   這是因為專用IP地址無法通過Internet路由，而只能在局域網內使用。   例如，在您的家裡，您可能有五台計算機連接到交換機，而這些計算機都使用專用IP地址。   當您發出訪問網絡的請求（例如訪問大學的網站）時，路由器會執行網絡地址轉換（NAT），該轉換可將您的私有IP地址轉換為公共IP地址和端口，從而使   代表您提出要求。   有一個特定範圍的IP地址保留為私有（供您和他人使用）供內部使用。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Address Class \n Private Address Range \n Default Subnet Mask \n \n \n \n \n Class A \n 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 \n 255.0.0.0 \n \n \n Class B \n 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 \n 255.255.0.0 \n \n \n Class C \n 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 \n 255.255.255.0 \n \n \n \n For class A, the range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 are all private addresses.

For class C, the most common of private IP scopes in use, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. This means if you choose 192.168.1.0 for your network, you would have 254 usable IP addresses. You would have this many usable IP addresses because the network is selected using the subnet mask, so only one octet is available for the host portion (there are 256 choices, but the first one (.0) is for the network address, and the last one (.255) is for the broadcast address). \n \n \n \n learn by doing \n 對於A類，範圍10.0.0.0到10.255.255.255都是私有地址。 這提供了1,670萬個地址供使用。 接下來，我們有B類，其使用範圍為172.16.0.0到172.31.255.255。 對於C類，範圍是192.168.0.0到192.168.255.255。 對於C類（最常用的專用IP範圍），子網掩碼為255.255.255.0。 這意味著，如果您為網絡選擇192.168.1.0，則將有254個可用IP地址。 您將擁有這麼多可用的IP地址，因為使用子網掩碼選擇了網絡，因此主機部分只能使用一個八位位組（有256個選擇，而第一個（.0）是網絡地址，並且 最後一個（.255）是廣播地址）。 通過實踐學習 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For each IP address and subnet mask given below, identify the correct address class. \n \n 對於下面給出的每個IP地址和子網掩碼，請確定正確的地址類別。 \n \n \n \n \n Address class \n \n \n \n IP address: 172.16.0.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 192.168.1.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 10.0.1.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 10.3.2.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n did I get this \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A network IP address of 192.168.1.1 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is an example of a class \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n A \n B \n C \n \xa0 address. \n \n \n The “localhost” for any computer uses the loopback address.

In unicast communication, data travels from a single device to another single device on the network. For example, when you go to www.google.com in your web browser, your computer makes a request to one of Google’s web servers using unicast communication, and one of Google’s computers then sends the data back using unicast communication to just your computer. \n 最常見和最廣泛使用的方法稱為單播。 在單播通信中，數據從網絡上的單個設備傳輸到另一個單個設備。 例如，當您使用網絡瀏覽器訪問www.google.com時，您的計算機使用單播通信向一台Google的網絡服務器發出請求，然後其中一台Google的計算機通過單播通信將數據發送回您的計算機。 \n \n When data is sent as a broadcast communication, it travels from a single device (such as your computer) to every other device on the network. This data will not travel outside the current subnet, though, when using broadcast. An example of broadcast communications would be if your system administrator was going to shut down a switch for maintenance. She may send out a broadcast message to everyone connected to that switch, warning them that their connectivity is going to be lost in the next ten minutes. You can think of this type of messaging like a teacher who is about to announce the next homework assignment. The teacher may say (or broadcast), “Class, here is your homework for tonight.” The message is directed at everyone in the class (or subnet) and they all should receive the message. \n 當數據作為廣播通信發送時，它從單個設備（例如您的計算機）傳輸到網絡上的所有其他設備。 但是，使用廣播時，該數據不會在當前子網之外傳播。 例如，如果您的系統管理員要關閉交換機進行維護，則為廣播通信。 她可能會向連接到該交換機的每個人發出廣播消息，警告他們在接下來的十分鐘內將失去連接。 您可以將這種消息傳遞想像為即將宣布下一個作業的老師。 老師可能會說（或廣播）“課，這是你今晚的作業”。 該消息針對班級（或子網）中的每個人，他們所有人都應該收到該消息。 \n \n \n \n The final method of data travel is called multicast. In multicast communication, data travels from a single device to multiple other devices on the network, but not necessarily to all of them, like it does when using broadcast communication. Also, this can expand outside of a single subnet. This works well when sharing a resource, such as streaming video. You can think of this type of communication as the Internet equivalent of watching satellite TV. For satellite TV, the signal is being sent out, but you have to “tune in” in order to receive (view) the data. \n 數據傳輸的最終方法稱為多播。 在多播通信中，數據從單個設備傳輸到網絡上的多個其他設備，但不一定要傳輸到所有其他設備，就像使用廣播通信時那樣。 而且，這可以擴展到單個子網之外。 在共享資源（例如流視頻）時，此方法效果很好。 您可以將這種類型的通信視為觀看衛星電視的互聯網。 對於衛星電視，正在發送信號，但是您必須“調入”才能接收（查看）數據。 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'IPv4 Data Flows\xa0IPv4數據流.html'}, {'title': 'Assigning an IP Address\xa0分配IP地址', 'text': "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n There are four components that make up a properly configured IPv4 network client: IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and domain name system (DNS) IP address. \n 正確配置IPv4網絡客戶端的過程由四個部分組成：IP地址，子網掩碼，默認網關和域名系統（DNS）IP \n 地址。 \n The first component of a properly configured IPv4 network client is the IP address. This is the logical name assigned to that particular host. In the image below, you can see that the host is assigned 200.200.200.5. No other device on the network can have this exact IP address or conflicts will occur. This IP address is like the device’s first name: no one else in its family (or network in this case) can have this IP address. \n 正確配置的IPv4網絡客戶端的第一部分是IP地址。這是分配給該特定主機的邏輯名稱。在下圖中，您可以看到為主機分配了200.200.200.5。網絡上的任何其他設備都不能具有此確切的IP地址，否則會發生衝突。該IP地址就像設備的名字一樣：其係列（在這種情況下為網絡）中沒有其他人可以使用此IP地址。 \n \n The second component of a properly configured IPv4 network client is the subnet mask. The subnet mask is required to ensure that the host knows what other IP addresses are on its network (which is defined by the subnet mask). In this example, the default class C subnet mask was used, which is 255.255.255.0. This tells the client that its host’s IP address resides on the 200.200.200.0 network, so other IPs in the 200.200.200.x range will be in the same subnet. \n 正確配置的IPv4網絡客戶端的第二個組件是子網掩碼。 需要子網掩碼以確保主機知道其網絡上還有哪些其他IP地址（由子網掩碼定義）。 在此示例中，使用了默認的C類子網掩碼，即255.255.255.0。 這告訴客戶端其主機的IP地址位於200.200.200.0網絡上，因此200.200.200.x範圍內的其他IP將位於同一子網中。 \n The third component of a properly configured IPv4 network client is the default gateway. This is the IP address of the device (normally a router) that connects this particular network to another network. For example, if our host wants to talk to someone outside of the 200.200.200.0 network, it would send the message to this default gateway (200.200.200.10 in our example), and this device will forward that request outside of the network. \n 正確配置的IPv4網絡客戶端的第三個組件是默認網關。 這是將該特定網絡連接到另一個網絡的設備（通常是路由器）的IP地址。 例如，如果我們的主機希望與200.200.200.0網絡外部的某人交談，則它將消息發送到該默認網關（在我們的示例中為200.200.200.10），並且該設備將把該請求轉發到網絡外部。 \n The final component of a properly configured IPv4 network client is the DNS server IP address, or WINS server IP. The DNS server is the domain name system server, and is responsible for converting domain names into IP addresses for the host. For example, if you wanted to go to www.google.com, your host doesn’t know where that is, but the DNS server does know the location. Providing your host with the DNS server address allows it to send the request to the DNS server, which will convert the name into an IP address, and send that address back to the requesting host, which can then go to that IP address with the request. A WINS server is like a DNS server, but is specific to Windows NetBIOS computer names and IP addresses. WINS is usually used inside a Windows network, while DNS is used for clients on the Internet. \n 正確配置的IPv4網絡客戶端的最後一個組件是DNS服務器IP地址或WINS服務器IP。 DNS服務器是域名系統服務器，並負責將域名轉換為主機的IP地址。 例如，如果您想訪問www.google.com，則您的主機不知道該地址在哪裡，但是DNS服務器確實知道該位置。 為您的主機提供DNS服務器地址可以使其向DNS服務器發送請求，DNS服務器會將名稱轉換為IP地址，然後將該地址發送回請求主機，然後主機可以隨請求轉到該IP地址 。 WINS服務器類似於DNS服務器，但特定於Windows NetBIOS計算機名稱和IP地址。 WINS通常在Windows網絡內部使用，而DNS用於Internet上的客戶端。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: On this network, no other device can have the IP address of 192.168.10.1 or conflicts may occur. \n 是非題：在該網絡上，沒有其他設備的IP地址為192.168.10.1，否則可能會發生衝突。 \n \n \n \n \n True False \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IP addresses are assigned to a client or workstation using either static or dynamic configuration. In static configuration, we find a simple method for assigning an address, but it is more time-consuming. This method requires the technician to input the four required pieces of information that make up an address (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server IP address). This is prone to human errors, since a single, mistyped digit will cause the device to be unable to connect to the network. Also, because each client has to be configured individually and no repeating of IP addresses is allowed, this requires detailed documentation of the used IP addresses and becomes impractical for large networks very quickly. \n IP地址使用靜態或動態配置分配給客戶端或工作站。 在靜態配置中，我們找到了一種分配地址的簡單方法，但是這比較耗時。 此方法要求技術人員輸入組成地址（IP地址，子網掩碼，默認網關和DNS服務器IP地址）的四個必需信息。 這很容易發生人為錯誤，因為單個錯誤鍵入的數字將導致設備無法連接到網絡。 另外，由於必須分別配置每個客戶端，並且不允許重複IP地址，因此這需要詳細記錄已使用的IP地址，並且對於大型網絡來說非常不切實際。 \n Dynamic configuration is much quicker and easier. There are two dynamic configuration methods: DHCP and BOOTP. Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) is simple for large networks and less confusing, because a server handles the assignment of the IP addresses for the client, as well as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server. In practice, the network administrator simply provides the DHCP server with a range of IP addresses to hand out, and the DHCP server does all the work for the network administrator. The DHCP server gives a client an IP address and the associated parameters, as well as a “lease time.” The lease time is the specific amount of time the client is allowed to use that IP address. When the lease is nearing the end of its term, the DHCP server gives the client the option of keeping the lease longer (if it is still using it), or the server can take the lease back to reuse (if it cannot get in touch with the client at the lease renewal). Most large-scale networks and most home networks use DHCP for configuration. \n 動態配置更快，更容易。動態配置方法有兩種：DHCP和BOOTP。動態主機配置協議（DHCP）對於大型網絡來說很簡單，並且不易混淆，因為服務器可以處理客戶端IP地址的分配以及子網掩碼，默認網關和DNS服務器。實際上，網絡管理員只需為DHCP服務器提供一系列IP地址即可分發，而DHCP服務器將為網絡管理員完成所有工作。 DHCP服務器為客戶端提供IP地址和關聯的參數，以及“租用時間”。租用時間是允許客戶端使用該IP地址的特定時間。當租約即將到期時，DHCP服務器會為客戶端提供延長租約（如果仍在使用租約）的選項，或者服務器可以將租約重新使用（如果無法聯繫）與客戶續約）。大多數大型網絡和大多數家庭網絡都使用DHCP進行配置。 \n Bootstrap protocol, more commonly referred to as BOOTP, is an older dynamic addressing protocol and only assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. BOOTP doesn’t support providing DNS server information or WINS server information. BOOTP is considered obsolete now, as it has been replaced by DHCP. DHCP, on the other hand, is based upon the legacy BOOTP protocol but added DNS, WINS and other variables that are related to newer standards like voice-over IP. If your network is dynamically configured, DHCP is most likely in use. \n Bootstrap協議（通常稱為BOOTP）是一種較舊的動態尋址協議，僅分配IP地址，子網掩碼和默認網關。 BOOTP不支持提供DNS服務器信息或WINS服務器信息。 BOOTP現在已被淘汰，因為它已被DHCP取代。 另一方面，DHCP基於舊式BOOTP協議，但添加了DNS，WINS和其他與諸如語音IP之類的新標準相關的變量。 如果您的網絡是動態配置的，則最有可能使用DHCP。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A technician must manually enter the IP address into the computer when \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n static \n dynamic \n \xa0 configuration is used. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n checkpoint \n \n \n \n \n Take a minute to stop and reflect on your progress for this learning objective. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Do you feel comfortable with this material and ready to move on? \n \n Yes, I feel confident in my ability to meet this learning objective.

Now, our cellphones, laptops, tablets, thermostats, refrigerators, TVs, and more are all being connected to the network and they all need IP addresses. Due to the 32-bit addresses used by IPv4, we were limited to 4.2 billion IP addresses, but by increasing the address space to 128-bit addresses in IPv6, the number of IP addresses available has increased to 340 undecillion addresses. This is 5 x 10 28 \xa0 IPv6 addresses for every person on the planet, including children. \n Internet協議版本6的開發是為了提供更多的公共IP地址，因為由於我們生活中網絡設備的激增，IPv4公共尋址空間已耗盡。 現在，我們的手機，筆記本電腦，平板電腦，恆溫器，冰箱，電視等已全部連接到網絡，並且它們都需要IP地址。 由於IPv4使用32位地址，因此我們只能使用42億個IP地址，但是通過將地址空間增加到IPv6中的128位地址，可用的IP地址數量已增加到340個十億位地址。 這是地球上每個人（包括孩子）的5 x 1028 IPv6地址。 \n IPv5 was designed, but eventually skipped in implementation, because it was only a 64-bit address and some feared it didn’t provide a large enough pool of available IP addresses. This experimental protocol was abandoned, but many of its concepts were incorporated into the IPv6 protocol, as well as some other protocols. \n IPv5是經過設計的，但最終被跳過，因為它只是一個64位地址，並且有人擔心它不能提供足夠大的可用IP地址池。 該實驗性協議已被放棄，但其許多概念以及其他一些協議已合併到IPv6協議中。 \n \n \n \n \n Number of Addresses \n \n \n IPv4 \n 2 32 \n 4,294,967,296 \n \n \n IPv6 \n 2 128 \n 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'Assigning an IP Address\xa0分配IP地址.html'}, {'title': 'Benefits of IPv6\xa0IPv6的好處', 'text': 'IPv6 has many benefits over IPv4, the biggest of which is the number of available IP addresses. In IPv6, there is no broadcast provided, which frees up IP addresses, reduces the amount of traffic sent over the network, and increases bandwidth. Also, IPv6 doesn’t allow packets to be fragmented (broken into pieces) during transmission. This is handled by the protocol by resizing the maximum transmission unit size each time a session is created between two devices. \n 與IPv4相比，IPv6有很多好處，其中最大的好處就是可用IP地址的數量。 在IPv6中，沒有提供廣播，這釋放了IP地址，減少了通過網絡發送的流量，並增加了帶寬。 另外，IPv6不允許在傳輸過程中將數據包分段（分成碎片）。 協議通過每次在兩個設備之間創建會話時調整最大傳輸單元大小來解決此問題。 \n A major benefit of IPv6 is that it allows for dual stack implementation, which means that IPv4 and IPv6 can run simultaneously on a device and provide service to the device from either protocol without conflict.

Instead of the dotted-decimal notation we used in IPv4 with addresses like 192.168.1.1, IPv6 uses eight groupings of four hexadecimal digits in each group. Each group is then broken apart by a colon (:). An example of an IPv6 address is 2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:4815:54ae. \n 儘管IPv6相對於IPv4進行了許多改進，但是人們看到的關於IPv6的最值得注意的事情是地址的格式。 IPv6不是在IPv4中使用像192.168.1.1這樣的地址使用的點分十進製表示法，而是在每個組中使用四個十六進制數字組成的八組。 然後，每個組用冒號（:)分隔。 IPv6地址的示例是2002：0000：0000：0000：0000：0000：0000：4815：54ae。 \n A hexadecimal digit allows for counting from zero to 15 using the digits 0-9, then the letters A through F. Each hexadecimal digit replaces four binary digits (or four 1s and 0s), allowing us to write an IPv6 address using (at most) 32 hexadecimal digits. \n 十六進制數字允許使用數字0-9從0到15進行計數，然後使用字母A至F。每個十六進制數字都替換了四個二進制數字（或四個1和0），從而使我們可以使用（最多為 ）32個十六進制數字。 \n Luckily, the creators of IPv6 allowed for a shorthand. First, anytime there are leading zeros, they can be dropped. This is equivalent to dropping the leading zeros in the number 0010 to 10. The numbers are equivalent, as long as the zeros are in front of the other digits. The second shorthand technique involves several groupings of four zeros. When multiple groupings of four zeros are present, they can be represented by a double colon (::). Note that you can only use the double colon once per address, because the only way to know how many sets of zeros you’ve replaced with the double colon is to compare the shorthand address with the total number of bits available. \n 幸運的是，IPv6的創建者允許使用簡寫形式。 首先，只要有前導零，就可以將其丟棄。 這等效於將數字0010中的前導零刪除為10。這些數字是等效的，只要零在其他數字的前面即可。 第二種速記技術涉及四個零的幾個分組。 當存在四個零的多個分組時，可以用雙冒號（：:)表示。 請注意，每個地址只能使用雙冒號一次，因為要知道用雙冒號替換了多少個零集的唯一方法是將速記地址與可用位數進行比較。 \n \n EXAMPLE 範例 \n \n \n \n 2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:4815:54ae can be rewritten.

Anycasting is designed to let one host initiate the efficient updating of router tables for a group of hosts. IPv6 can determine which gateway host is closest and sends the packets to that host as though it were a unicast communication. In turn, that host can anycast to another host in the group until all routing tables are updated. \n IPv6中的數據流類似於IPv4中的數據流。 實際上，單播和多播的工作方式與IPv4相同。 但是，由於IPv6中沒有廣播，因此已將其替換為“任何廣播”。 Anycast允許數據從單個源設備傳輸到網絡上多個（但特定的）設備中最接近的一個。 任意廣播旨在讓一個主機為一組主機啟動路由器表的有效更新。 IPv6可以確定哪個網關主機最接近，並將數據包發送到該主機，就好像它是單播通信一樣。 相應地，該主機可以向組中的另一台主機任意廣播，直到更新所有路由表為止。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Which of the following is not a benefit of IPv6 over IPv4? \n \n More IP addresses.

This type of transmission is great for all network data types, especially those that need delivery to be assured. \n TCP是一種面向連接的協議，可確保將數據段從一台設備可靠地傳輸到另一台設備。 在傳輸過程中，如果某個段丟失，則發起方設備將檢測到該段並將其重新發送或重新傳輸。 每次通信在收到後都會得到確認，從而提供一個安全的模型來確保成功進行通信。 這種傳輸方式適用於所有網絡數據類型，尤其是那些需要確保傳輸的網絡數據類型。 \n When a TCP communication is initiated, the originator and receiver perform a “three-way handshake” before starting the data transmission. In the first step, the originator sends a packet with a synchronization (SYN) flag set. Next, the receiver acknowledges receipt of this SYN flagged packet by sending back a synchronization-acknowledged (SYN-ACK) flagged packet. Finally, the originator sends an acknowledgement of the synchronization-acknowledged flagged packet, and then data transmission occurs. \n 啟動TCP通信時，發起方和接收方在開始數據傳輸之前執行“三向握手”。 第一步，發起方發送一個設置了同步（SYN）標誌的數據包。 接下來，接收器通過發回一個同步確認（SYN-ACK）標記數據包來確認此SYN標記數據包的接收。 最後，始發者發送對已同步確認的標記數據包的確認，然後發生數據傳輸。 \n EXAMPLE 範例 \n \n \n \n Think of this like two students who want to discuss an important project that is upcoming.

Because of the three-way handshake in TCP, as well as all the delivery assurance and quality control, TCP has a good amount of network overhead that slows down its communications. Network engineers realized that sometimes you don’t need delivery assurance or quality control. So UDP was established. \n UDP（或用戶數據報協議）被開發為無連接協議，目的是通過TCP傳輸提高網絡速度。 由於TCP中的三向握手以及所有的交付保證和質量控制，TCP具有大量的網絡開銷，從而降低了其通信速度。 網絡工程師意識到有時您不需要交付保證或質量控制。 這樣就建立了UDP。 \n UDP is considered unreliable, because if a segment is dropped during transmission, the sending device doesn’t know and doesn’t care. There is no retransmission. Once data is sent, it is gone. This is good, though, for audio and video streaming. In these applications, the data transferred is enormously large, and if a single segment is dropped it doesn’t affect the overall quality of the audio or video sent. \n UDP被認為是不可靠的，因為如果在傳輸過程中丟棄了網段，則發送設備將不知道也不在乎。 沒有重傳。 數據一旦發送，就消失了。 但是，這對於音頻和視頻流來說是很好的。 在這些應用中，傳輸的數據非常大，如果丟棄單個片段，則不會影響所發送的音頻或視頻的整體質量。 \n EXAMPLE 範例 \n \n \n \n I like to think of UDP as my college calculus teacher. He started at one side of the board at 8 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was done at the other side of the board. He never asked if the students understood what he said or wrote, he just kept transmitting. This is a great example of UDP. \n 我喜歡將UDP視為我的大學微積分老師。 他在上午8點從董事會的一側開始，到上午9點，他在董事會的另一側完成了工作。 他從不問學生是否理解他所說或寫的內容，他只是不斷地傳播。 這是UDP的一個很好的例子。 \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'TCP and UDP TCP與UDP.html'}, {'title': 'TCP Vs.

TCP uses windowing, discussed in more detail later, to control the amount of data sent at a given time based on changing network speeds, but UDP simply transmits everything once with no windowing. TCP also supports segment sequencing; UDP just hopes it gets to the destination in the right order. Finally, TCP waits for acknowledgements, but UDP just hopes it got there. To simplify it, TCP is an assured and reliable communication method, UDP is just a best-effort model. \n TCP和UDP有很多區別。 TCP是可靠的，但UDP是不可靠的。 TCP專注於使用三向握手的面向連接的通信，而UDP是無連接的。 TCP使用開窗（稍後將更詳細地討論）來基於不斷變化的網絡速度來控制在給定時間發送的數據量，但是UDP僅傳輸所有信息一次而沒有開窗。 TCP還支持段排序； UDP只是希望它以正確的順序到達目的地。 最後，TCP等待確認，但是UDP只是希望它到達目的地。 為簡化起見，TCP是一種有保證且可靠的通信方法，UDP只是一種盡力而為的模型。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: UDP is slower than TCP because UDP transmits everything at once with no windowing. \n 是非題：UDP比TCP慢，因為UDP一次無窗口傳輸所有內容。 \n \n True False \n \n \n \n True or False: TCP is more reliable than UDP. \n 是非題：TCP比UDP更可靠。 \n \n True False \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Golda needs to stream large amounts of video quickly.

UDP is best suited for video streaming because it transmits data all at once. By transmitting data all at once, UDP can transmit large amounts of data quickly. Because there is so much data in a video, any loss of small data packets in transmission will likely not be noticeable to the end user. \n 正確。 UDP最適合視頻流，因為它可以一次傳輸所有數據。 通過一次全部傳輸數據，UDP可以快速傳輸大量數據。 由於視頻中的數據太多，因此最終用戶可能不會注意到傳輸中丟失的小數據包。 \n \n \n \n \n Using the dropdown menus, select the protocol that best fits the description. \n 使用下拉菜單，選擇最適合描述的協議。 \n Connection oriented: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n Connectionless: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n No windowing or retransmission: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n No sequencing: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n Acknowledge segments: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n Segment sequencing: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n Segment retransmission and flow control through windowing: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n No acknowledgements: \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n TCP \n UDP \n \n \n \n \n \n Reset this Activity \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'TCP Vs.

If you have ever copied a file from a network share drive on the Windows operating system, you have seen windowing. Have you ever noticed when you copy a file over the network, it may start out saying there are “2 minutes remaining” until completion, then it jumps up to “3 hours remaining,” then back down to “30 minutes remaining”? This is TCP windowing in action. \n TCP還支持稱為窗口化的概念。 如果您曾經從Windows操作系統上的網絡共享驅動器中復製過文件，則會看到窗口。 您是否曾經註意到通過網絡複製文件時，它可能會說“剩餘2分鐘”直到完成，然後跳到“剩餘3小時”，然後又跳回到“剩餘30分鐘”？ 這是TCP窗口在起作用。 \n Essentially, when a communication session is established with TCP, it first performs the three-way handshake. Next, it starts with a small window size, like windows size 1 in the image below, where a single segment is sent over the network and acknowledged. If this is successful, it increases the window size to 2, sending two segments at a time. It continues to do this, increasing the number of segments each time, transmitting more data in each window until an error occurs and retransmissions must be done. If errors occur, TCP understands that it must have been transmitting too fast, so it shrinks the window to slow down communication. As transmissions occur successfully, it again increases the window to push more data in each window. This window size is continually adjusted to get the most segments per window with the least errors in communication. \n 本質上，當使用TCP建立通信會話時，它首先執行三向握手。 接下來，它以較小的窗口大小開始，如下面的圖片中的窗口大小1所示，其中單個段通過網絡發送並確認。 如果成功，它將窗口大小增加到2，一次發送兩個段。 它會繼續這樣做，每次增加段數，在每個窗口中傳輸更多數據，直到發生錯誤並必須重新傳輸為止。 如果發生錯誤，TCP知道它一定傳輸速度太快，因此它縮小了窗口以減慢通信速度。 隨著傳輸成功進行，它將再次增加窗口以在每個窗口中推送更多數據。 不斷調整此窗口大小，以使每個窗口獲得最多的段，並且通信錯誤最少。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Put the steps of a TCP communication session in the correct order. \n 以正確的順序放置TCP通信會話的步驟。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Segments two and three are sent over the network. \n \n \n \n Segments two and three are acknowledged. \n \n \n \n Three-way handshake. \n \n \n \n Segment one is acknowledged. \n \n \n \n Window size 2 is established. \n \n \n \n Window size 1 is established. \n \n \n \n A single segment (segment 1) is sent over the network. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: In TCP windowing, if an error occurs, TCP understands that it must have been transmitting too fast, so it shrinks the window to slow down communication. \n 是非題：在TCP窗口中，如果發生錯誤，則TCP知道傳輸速度太快，因此會縮小窗口以減慢通信速度 \n \n True False \n \n \n \n \n \n Reset this Activity \n \n \n \n checkpoint \n \n \n \n Take a minute to stop and reflect on your progress for this learning objective. \n 花一點時間停下來，為這個學習目標反思自己的進步。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'TCP Windowing TCP窗口.html'}, {'title': 'Networking Transfer Protocols 網絡傳輸協議', 'text': "TCP and IP contains a suite of many different transfer protocols for routing information across networks. Each protocol uses a different well-known port to keep its traffic separate from the others. Web browsing occurs using either hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). When it uses HTTP, it uses port 80. If, however, the client requests that the site be sent securely using encryption, then it uses the HTTPS protocol and port 443. When being sent securely, the client and server use either secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS). These additional layers are put on top of the existing HTTP standard to encrypt the data connection between the client and the server. \n TCP and\xa0 IP包含一組用於在網絡之間路由信息的許多不同的傳輸協議。 每種協議使用不同的眾所周知的端口，以使其流量彼此獨立。 使用超文本傳輸協議（HTTP）或安全超文本傳輸協議（HTTPS）進行Web瀏覽。 當使用HTTP時，它將使用端口80。但是，如果客戶端請求使用加密安全地發送站點，則它將使用HTTPS協議和端口443。在安全發送時，客戶端和服務器將使用安全套接字層 （SSL）或傳輸層安全性（TLS）。 這些額外的層放在現有HTTP標準之上，以加密客戶端和服務器之間的數據連接。 \n In addition to browsing the web, there are many other things that can be done on the network and each uses its own dedicated port number to keep the traffic separate. File transfer protocol (FTP) uses port 21. FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. \n 除了瀏覽網絡之外，網絡上還有許多其他事情可以做，每件事都使用自己的專用端口號來保持流量分開。 文件傳輸協議（FTP）使用端口21。FTP是一種標準網絡協議，用於通過基於TCP的網絡（例如Internet）將計算機文件從一台主機傳輸到另一台主機。 FTP建立在客戶端-服務器體系結構上，並在客戶端和服務器之間使用單獨的控制和數據連接。 \n Telnet is a text-based remote access program for computers that communicates over port 23. Telnet is a user command and an underlying TCP and IP protocol for accessing computers remotely. Through telnet, an administrator or another user can access someone else's computer remotely. Unfortunately, telnet is an unsecured protocol where all the information between the client and server is communicated in clear text, so anyone who can capture this data can read it easily. For this reason, secure shell (SSH), which uses port 22, was introduced to replace telnet. SSH is a cryptographic (encrypted) network protocol for initiating text-based shell sessions on remote machines, similar to telnet but with the added strength of encryption. \n Telnet是用於通過端口23進行通信的計算機的基於文本的遠程訪問程序。Telnet是用戶命令和用於遠程訪問計算機的基礎TCP and IP協議。 通過telnet，管理員或其他用戶可以遠程訪問其他人的計算機。 不幸的是，telnet是一種不安全的協議，其中客戶端與服務器之間的所有信息均以明文形式進行通信，因此任何可以捕獲此數據的人都可以輕鬆地讀取它。 因此，引入了使用端口22的安全外殼（SSH）來代替telnet。 SSH是一種加密（加密）網絡協議，用於在遠程計算機上啟動基於文本的Shell會話，類似於telnet，但具有增強的加密強度。 \n The domain name system (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or to a private network. It allows for the translation of IP addresses to domain names, and from domain names to IP addresses. Remote desktop protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides users with a graphical interface to connect to other computers over a network connection using port 3389. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software. RDP is a huge step up over telnet and SSH, because you receive a graphical environment to control the other user’s machine, just as if you were sitting in front of their Windows desktop. \n 域名系統（DNS）是用於計算機，服務或連接到Internet或專用網絡的任何資源的分層分佈式命名系統。 它允許將IP地址轉換為域名，也可以將域名轉換為IP地址。 遠程桌面協議（RDP）是Microsoft開發的專有協議，它為用戶提供圖形界面以使用端口3389通過網絡連接連接到其他計算機。用戶為此目的使用RDP客戶端軟件，而另一台計算機必須運行 RDP服務器軟件。 RDP是telnet和SSH的一大進步，因為您將獲得一個圖形化的環境來控制其他用戶的計算機，就像坐在他們的Windows桌面前一樣。 \n Simple network management protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management. It is used for collecting information from and configuring network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers, on an Internet protocol (IP) network. SNMP traffic is sent over port 161. \n 簡單網絡管理協議（SNMP）是用於網絡管理的流行協議。 它用於從Internet協議（IP）網絡上的服務器，打印機，集線器，交換機和路由器等網絡設備收集信息並對其進行配置。 SNMP通信通過端口161發送。 \n Server message block (SMB) is a network protocol used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network using port 139. \n 服務器消息塊（SMB）是一種網絡協議，用於提供對文件，打印機和串行端口的共享訪問以及使用端口139的網絡上節點之間的其他通信。 \n The lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a directory service protocol that runs over port 389. LDAP provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories. The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model.輕型目錄訪問協議（LDAP）是在端口389上運行的目錄服務協議。LDAP提供了一種用於連接，搜索和修改Internet目錄的機制。 LDAP目錄服務基於客戶端-服務器模型。 \n Email 信箱 \n \n \n Email has evolved a lot over the years, but still operates on three main protocols. Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for sending email and most outbound email is sent using SMTP. SMTP uses port 25 to send email from network devices. \n 多年來，電子郵件已經有了很大的發展，但仍在三種主要協議上運行。 簡單郵件傳輸協議（SMTP）是用於發送電子郵件的Internet標準，大多數出站電子郵件都是使用SMTP發送的。 SMTP使用端口25從網絡設備發送電子郵件。 \n POP3 is the most common account type for personal email, but messages are typically deleted from the server when you check your email. \n POP3是最常見的個人電子郵件帳戶類型，但是當您檢查電子郵件時，通常會將郵件從服務器中刪除。 \n Internet message access protocol (IMAP) servers let you work with email messages without downloading them to your computer first. This allows for email to be synchronized (synced) across multiple devices, including your desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. IMAP uses port 143 to receive and synchronize your email. The real benefit of using IMAP, especially in today’s multiple device access world, is that it can change the read and delete state of messages across the multiple devices. For example, if I read a message on my phone, when I log into my desktop, the message will also show as having been read already. \n Internet郵件訪問協議（IMAP）服務器使您可以處理電子郵件，而無需先將其下載到計算機上。 這允許跨多個設備（包括台式機，筆記本電腦，平板電腦和智能手機）同步電子郵件。 IMAP使用端口143接收和同步您的電子郵件。 使用IMAP的真正好處（尤其是在當今的多設備訪問世界中）是，它可以更改跨多個設備的消息的讀取和刪除狀態。 例如，如果我在手機上閱讀了一條消息，則當我登錄到桌面時，該消息也將顯示為已被閱讀。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manny needs to set up an email service for his client that synchronizes email across devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets.

In a tic tac toe game, the “game server” needs to know where the \xa0 X s and \xa0 O s are in the board, to know whether player 1 or player 2 (or whoever is \xa0 X \xa0 and \xa0 O \xa0 won). \n There has also been an exercise about \xa0 drawing the actual tic tac toe gameboard \xa0 using text characters. \n The next logical step is to deal with handling user input. When a player (say player 1, who is \xa0 X ) wants to place an \xa0 X \xa0 on the screen, they can’t just click on a terminal. So we are going to approximate this clicking simply by asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece. \n As a reminder, our tic tac toe game is really a list of lists. The game starts out with an empty game board like this: \n \n game   =   [[ 0 ,   0 ,   0 ], \n\t [ 0 ,   0 ,   0 ], \n\t [ 0 ,   0 ,   0 ]] \n \n The computer asks Player 1 (X) what their move is (in the format \xa0 row,col ), and say they type \xa0 1,3 . Then the game would print out \n \n game   =   [[ 0 ,   0 ,   X ], \n\t [ 0 ,   0 ,   0 ], \n\t [ 0 ,   0 ,   0 ]] \n \n And ask Player 2 for their move, printing an \xa0 O \xa0 in that place. \n Things to note: \n \n For this exercise, assume that player 1 (the first player to move) will always be \xa0 X \xa0 and player 2 (the second player) will always be \xa0 O . \n Notice how in the example I gave coordinates for where I want to move starting from (1, 1) instead of (0, 0). To people who don’t program, starting to count at 0 is a strange concept, so it is better for the user experience if the row counts and column counts start at 1. This is not required, but whichever way you choose to implement this, it should be explained to the player. \n Ask the user to enter coordinates in the form “row,col” - a number, then a comma, then a number. Then you can use your Python skills to figure out which row and column they want their piece to be in. \n Don’t worry about checking whether someone won the game, but if a player tries to put a piece in a game position where there already is another piece, do not allow the piece to go there. \n \n Bonus: \n \n For the “standard” exercise, don’t worry about “ending” the game - no need to keep track of how many squares are full. In a bonus version, keep track of how many squares are full and automatically stop asking for moves when there are no more valid moves. \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'HW3.html'}, {'title': 'Concepts 概念', 'text': 'One review concept that is definitely needed (in addition to the \xa0 user input \xa0 that is the core of the exercise) is the need to “split” strings. \n （除了作為練習核心的用戶輸入之外）肯定需要一個審核概念是“拆分”字符串。 \n The user will input coordinates in the form “row,col”, which \xa0 input() \xa0 will then read in as a string. But we really want the numbers that come out of that string, to know which row and column to place the piece at. \n 用戶將以“ row，col”的形式輸入坐標，然後input（）將以字符串形式讀取。但是我們確實希望從該字符 串中得出的數字知道將片段放置在哪一行和哪一列。 \n One approach is to use the idea of \xa0 strings as lists \xa0 to extract the row and column numbers. This works great if your row and column numbers are always single digits - the row will always be at index 0 and the column will always be at index 2. But this breaks when the numbers are larger than one digit (I know, not going to happen in tic tac toe, but it’s easy to image extending this to other games). \n 一種方法是使用字符串作為列表的概念來提取行號和列號。如果行號和列號始終是一位數字，則該方法非 常有用-行將始終在索引0處，列始終在索引2。但是，當數字大於一位時，這種方法會中斷（我知道，會 在井字遊戲中發生，但很容易將其擴展到其他遊戲。 \n Instead, there are two string manipulation functions that will help you: \n  相反，有兩個字符串操作函數可以為您提供幫助： \n 1 .split() \xa0 - Takes a string and returns a list, using the separator as the split criteria. So if you have a string \xa0 name = "John Doe" \xa0 and do \xa0 name_list = name.split(" ") , \xa0 name_list \xa0 will be \xa0 ["John", "Doe"] . You can use any separator / split character you want. Just remember, that each of the elements returned back will be a string as well. \n 1.split（）-使用分隔符作為分割條件，獲取字符串並返回列表。因此，如果您有一個字符串名稱=“ John Doe”，並且執行name_list = name.split（“”），則name_list將為[“ John”，“ Doe”]。您可以使用所需的任何分隔符/拆分字符。請記住，返回的每個元素也將是一個字符串。 \n 2. .strip() \xa0 - Takes a string and removes the whitespace on the left and right sides of it. So you have a string \xa0 name = " Michele " , and you do \xa0 name = name.strip() , and now \xa0 name \xa0 will just be \xa0 "Michele" \xa0 - nice and clean. \n \n2..strip（）-接收字符串並刪除其左側和右側的空格。因此，您有一個字符串名稱=“ Michele”，並且您 執行了name = name.strip（），現在名稱將只是“ Michele”-乾淨整潔。我挑戰您找出如何在練習中使 用它們！ \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Concepts 概念.html'}, {'title': 'MAX OF THREE 最多三人', 'text': '\n \n Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three.
