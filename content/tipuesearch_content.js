TCP/IP specifies how data should be grouped, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination address. The TCP/IP model, along with many of its protocols, is maintained and managed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). \n TCP / IP提供數據的端到端連接。 TCP / IP指定如何在目標地址處對數據進行分組，尋址，傳輸，路由和接收。 TCP / IP模型及其許多協議由IETF（Internet工程任務組）維護和管理。 \n TCP/IP is one of two sets of protocols that collectively operate in the transport and network layers of the OSI model. \n TCP / IP是在OSI模型的傳輸層和網絡層中共同運行的兩組協議之一。 \n \n OSI Model.

As we discussed in previous modules, switches make their intelligent switching decisions (see the data link layer in the diagram above based on media access control (MAC) addresses. The MAC address, also known as the physical address, is the unique identifier hard coded on a network interface card by the manufacturer. Switches use these MAC addresses to identify which devices are on which switch ports, and forward traffic within the network segment to the correct ports based on these addresses. When data traffic needs to cross the boundaries of the network, it requires a logical address that the router can use to make intelligent routing decisions. In most modern networks, this is done by using TCP/IP addressing. Historically, other protocols existed, such as internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX) for Novell networks, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI for Microsoft networks. TCP/IP replaced these protocols almost exclusively due to its robust nature, reliability, and availability. \n 將數據從一個網段移動到另一個網段時，網絡設備需要邏輯地址-IPv4或IPv6地址（請參見上圖中的網 絡層）。正如我們在之前的模塊中討論的那樣，交換機做出明智的交換決策（請參見上圖中的數據鏈路 層，基於媒體訪問控制（MAC）地址。MAC地址，也稱為物理地址，是唯一的硬編碼標識符）交換機使用這 些MAC地址來識別哪些設備在哪個交換機端口上，然後根據這些地址將網段內的流量轉發到正確的端口。 網絡中，它需要路由器可以用來做出智能路由決策的邏輯地址。在大多數現代網絡中，這是通過使用 TCP / IP尋址來完成的。 / SPX）（用於Novell網絡，AppleTalk和用於Microsoft網絡的NetBEUI） ，TCP / IP幾乎完全由於其魯棒性，可靠性和可用性而取代了這些協議。不可靠。 \n While the majority of our networks today still use IPv4, many networks are migrating to the newer IPv6 addressing standards. Additionally, many networks are offering dual support to both IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition. The reason for this transition is that we were running out of valid IPv4 addresses. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, providing only 4.2 billion available addresses, but IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme. IPv6 allows for 2 128 addresses, or 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.4 x 10 38 ) unique IP addresses. IPv6 allows for more IP addresses than humanity could ever utilize.

The maximum value for any octet is 255 (2 8 -1) so therefore the maximum number of IPv4 addresses available is 2 32 , which equals 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. \n 每個八位位組由八位組成（一個字節或兩個半字節）。乘以四個八位位組，等於32位。任何八位位組的最大值為255 （28-1），因此，可用的IPv4地址的最大數量為232，等於4,294,967,296個唯一地址。 \n The presence of the subnet mask tells networking devices how much of the IP address belongs to the network and how much to the host. The 255.255.255.0 subnet represents that the first three octets are the network and the “0” represents the available number of hosts (nodes). So, the form is N.N.N.H. Think of the combination of IP and subnet as similar to regular postal addresses. You need a zip code (subnet) and street address (host). \n 子網掩碼的存在告訴網絡設備多少IP地址屬於網絡，多少屬於主機。 255.255.255.0子網表示前三個八位位組是網絡，“ 0”表示可用的主機（節點）數。因此，表格為N.N.N.H.可以將IP和子網的組合視為類似於常規郵政地址。您需要一個郵政編碼（子網）和街道地址（主機）。 \n There are five different classes in IPv4 labelled A through E, with classes A, B, and C used by computer networks and classes D and E reserved as experimental. As originally designed, the IP range is determined by the lead bits in the first octet and matched to one specific subnet mask. This is called "classful" addressing. When the IP class does not match the default subnet mask, it is called "classless." \n IPv4中有五種不同的類別，標記為A到E，計算機網絡使用的類別為A，B和C，D和E的類別保留為實驗用。按照最初的設計，IP範圍由第一個八位位組中的前導位確定，並與一個特定的子網掩碼匹配。這稱為“有類”尋址。如果IP類與默認子網掩碼不匹配，則稱為“無類”。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Addressing Notation 尋址符號.html'}, {'title': 'Network and Host Addresses\xa0網絡和主機地址', 'text': 'An IPv4 network address is further divided into two portions based upon the subnet mask: the network portion and the host portion. A subnet mask is a series of numbers used for routing traffic within a subnetwork. When a subnet mask is used to define the network portion, anywhere there is a binary “11111111” (or 255 in decimal) used, this area is considered part of the network portion. When a binary “00000000” (0 in decimal) is used, this represents the host portion of the address. The host represents a single device on the network, such as your computer or phone. \n IPv4網絡地址根據子網掩碼進一步分為兩部分：網絡部分和主機部分。子網掩碼是用於在子網內路由流量的一系列數字。當使用子網掩碼定義網絡部分時，在任何使用二進制“ 11111111”（或十進制255）的地方，該區域均被視為網絡部分的一部分。當使用二進制“ 00000000”（十進制為0）時，它表示地址的主機部分。主機代表網絡上的單個設備，例如您的計算機或電話。 \n The following two tables show the network and host portions of IP addresses. \n 以下兩個表顯示了IP地址的網絡部分和主機部分。 \n \n \n \n IP address (in decimal) \n 10 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n \n \n IP address (in binary) \n 00001010 \n 00000001 \n 00000010 \n 00000011 \n \n \n Subnet mask (in decimal) \n 255 \n 0 \n 0 \n 0 \n \n \n Subnet mask (in binary) \n 11111111 \n 00000000 \n 00000000 \n 00000000 \n \n \n \n Network bits \n Host bits \n Host bits \n Host bits \n \n \n \n \n In the example above, we see that our IP address is 10.1.2.3, and it has a class A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. (We will discuss subnet classes in more detail later in this module). If this subnet mask is converted to binary, we see is written as eight 1s, followed by 24 0s, giving us 255.0.0.0 in decimal notation. Therefore, wherever we see a 255 in a subnet mask, we know we are seeing the network portion defined. So, for this example, our specific host is 10.1.2.3 and our network address would be 10.0.0.0. \n 在上面的示例中，我們看到我們的IP地址為10.1.2.3，它的A類子網掩碼為255.0.0.0。 （在本模塊的後面，我們將 更詳細地討論子網類）。如果將此子網掩碼轉換為二進制，我們將看到它寫成八個1，然後是24 0，十進製表示為255 .0.0.0。因此，無論何時在子網掩碼中看到255，我們都知道看到了定義的網絡部分。因此，對於此示例，我們的特 定主機為10.1.2.3，我們的網絡地址為10.0.0.0。 \n \n E XAMPLE\xa0 \n 例子 \n \n \n If a network has an IP address of 192.168.1.2, and the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, we can identify the network and host portions of both addresses. To determine the network portion of the IP address, examine the subnet mask for which octets hold the value 255. In this case, the subnet mask has 255 in the first, second, and third octet. This means that the network portion of the IP address is the first, second, and third octet, as shown in the chart below. The remaining octet (the fourth octet) is the host portion of the address. \n 如果網絡的IP地址為192.168.1.2，子網掩碼為255.255.255.0，我們可以識別這兩個地址的網絡和主機部分。 要確定IP地址的網絡部分，請檢查其八位位組的子網掩碼為255的子網掩碼。在這種情況下，該子網掩碼在第一個， 第二個和第三個八位位組中具有255。這意味著IP地址的網絡部分是第一個，第二個和第三個八位位組，如下圖所示 。剩餘的八位位組（第四個八位位組）是地址的主機部分。 \n \n \n \n \n Network Portion \n Host Portion \n \n \n IP Address: 192.168.1.2 \n 192.168.1 \n 2 \n \n \n Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 \n 255.255.255 \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Network and Host Addresses\xa0網絡和主機地址.html'}, {'title': 'IPv4 Address Classes IPv4地址類別', 'text': 'As you can see, when the subnet mask has a 255 in it, it is defining the network portion of the address.

A standard class A subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 is used for all networks where the first octet starts with a number between 1 and 126.

In this course, we only deal with “classful” subnet masks — the ones that only contain values of 255 and 0. In future courses, you may see other subnet masks used to further break apart the networks. \n 因此，該地址屬於A類類別。 在本課程中，我們僅處理“有類”子網掩碼-僅包含255和0的值。在以後的課程中，您可能會看到其他子網掩碼用於進一步拆分網絡。 \n \n \n \n Address Class \n Value in First Octet \n Classful Mask (Dotted Decimal) \n Classful Mask (Prefix Notation) \n \n \n \n \n Class A \n 1 – 126 \n 255.0.0.0 \n /8 \n \n \n Class B \n 128 – 191 \n 255.255.0.0 \n /16 \n \n \n Class C \n 192 – 223 \n 255.255.255.0 \n /24 \n \n \n \n As you can see in the address classes table, class A references networks with the first octet having a value of 1-126, class B references 128-191, class C references 192-223. There is also a special address called the loopback address, which is 127.0.0.1. The entire range of 127.x.x.x is reserved to support this loopback address. A loopback address is an IP reserved to reference the computer on which you are currently working. Every computer knows to answer up for itself when a reference to 127.0.0.1 is given. This is also known as as the “localhost.” \n 如您在地址類別表中看到的，類別A引用第一個八位位組的值是1-126的網絡，類別B引用128-191，類別C引用192-223。 還有一個稱為回送地址的特殊地址，即127.0.0.1。 保留127.x.x.x的整個範圍以支持此環回地址。 回送地址是保留的IP，用於引用您當前正在使用的計算機。 當給出對127.0.0.1的引用時，每台計算機都知道會自己回答。 這也稱為“本地主機”。 \n To route your traffic over the Internet, you are required to have a publically routable IP address. These addresses are globally managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). If you desire to have one of these addresses, you must purchase them for use to ensure no one else has that specific number. For most users, this is done for you by your Internet service provider (ISP), but if you have a need for numerous public IP addresses, you can buy a block of them from ICANN. \n 要通過Internet路由流量，您需要具有可公開路由的IP地址。 這些地址由互聯網名稱與數字地址分配機構（ICANN）全局管理。 如果您希望擁有這些地址之一，則必須購買它們以確保沒有其他人擁有該特定號碼。 對於大多數用戶而言，這是由Internet服務提供商（ISP）為您完成的，但是如果您需要大量的公共IP地址，則可以從ICANN購買其中的一部分。 \n Private IP addresses, on the other hand, can be used by anyone without any prior coordination. This is because private IP addresses are not routable over the Internet and are only used inside your local area network. For example, at your home, you may have five computers hooked up to your switch and those machines are all using private IP addresses. When you make a request to go outside the network, like to visit a college’s website, your router performs a network address translation (NAT) that allows your private IP address to be converted into a public IP address and a port, which then makes the request on your behalf. There is a specific range of IP addresses that are reserved as private for internal use (by you and others). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 另一方面，任何人都可以使用私有IP地址，而無需事先協調。   這是因為專用IP地址無法通過Internet路由，而只能在局域網內使用。   例如，在您的家裡，您可能有五台計算機連接到交換機，而這些計算機都使用專用IP地址。   當您發出訪問網絡的請求（例如訪問大學的網站）時，路由器會執行網絡地址轉換（NAT），該轉換可將您的私有IP地址轉換為公共IP地址和端口，從而使   代表您提出要求。   有一個特定範圍的IP地址保留為私有（供您和他人使用）供內部使用。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Address Class \n Private Address Range \n Default Subnet Mask \n \n \n \n \n Class A \n 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 \n 255.0.0.0 \n \n \n Class B \n 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 \n 255.255.0.0 \n \n \n Class C \n 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 \n 255.255.255.0 \n \n \n \n For class A, the range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 are all private addresses.

For class C, the most common of private IP scopes in use, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. This means if you choose 192.168.1.0 for your network, you would have 254 usable IP addresses. You would have this many usable IP addresses because the network is selected using the subnet mask, so only one octet is available for the host portion (there are 256 choices, but the first one (.0) is for the network address, and the last one (.255) is for the broadcast address). \n \n \n \n learn by doing \n 對於A類，範圍10.0.0.0到10.255.255.255都是私有地址。 這提供了1,670萬個地址供使用。 接下來，我們有B類，其使用範圍為172.16.0.0到172.31.255.255。 對於C類，範圍是192.168.0.0到192.168.255.255。 對於C類（最常用的專用IP範圍），子網掩碼為255.255.255.0。 這意味著，如果您為網絡選擇192.168.1.0，則將有254個可用IP地址。 您將擁有這麼多可用的IP地址，因為使用子網掩碼選擇了網絡，因此主機部分只能使用一個八位位組（有256個選擇，而第一個（.0）是網絡地址，並且 最後一個（.255）是廣播地址）。 通過實踐學習 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For each IP address and subnet mask given below, identify the correct address class. \n \n 對於下面給出的每個IP地址和子網掩碼，請確定正確的地址類別。 \n \n \n \n \n Address class \n \n \n \n IP address: 172.16.0.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 192.168.1.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 10.0.1.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n IP address: 10.3.2.1 \n Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 \n \n \xa0 \n -- \n Class A \n Class B \n Class C \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n did I get this \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A network IP address of 192.168.1.1 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is an example of a class \xa0 \xa0 \n -- \n A \n B \n C \n \xa0 address. \n \n \n The “localhost” for any computer uses the loopback address.

In unicast communication, data travels from a single device to another single device on the network. For example, when you go to www.google.com in your web browser, your computer makes a request to one of Google’s web servers using unicast communication, and one of Google’s computers then sends the data back using unicast communication to just your computer. \n 最常見和最廣泛使用的方法稱為單播。 在單播通信中，數據從網絡上的單個設備傳輸到另一個單個設備。 例如，當您使用網絡瀏覽器訪問www.google.com時，您的計算機使用單播通信向一台Google的網絡服務器發出請求，然後其中一台Google的計算機通過單播通信將數據發送回您的計算機。 \n \n When data is sent as a broadcast communication, it travels from a single device (such as your computer) to every other device on the network. This data will not travel outside the current subnet, though, when using broadcast. An example of broadcast communications would be if your system administrator was going to shut down a switch for maintenance. She may send out a broadcast message to everyone connected to that switch, warning them that their connectivity is going to be lost in the next ten minutes. You can think of this type of messaging like a teacher who is about to announce the next homework assignment. The teacher may say (or broadcast), “Class, here is your homework for tonight.” The message is directed at everyone in the class (or subnet) and they all should receive the message. \n 當數據作為廣播通信發送時，它從單個設備（例如您的計算機）傳輸到網絡上的所有其他設備。 但是，使用廣播時，該數據不會在當前子網之外傳播。 例如，如果您的系統管理員要關閉交換機進行維護，則為廣播通信。 她可能會向連接到該交換機的每個人發出廣播消息，警告他們在接下來的十分鐘內將失去連接。 您可以將這種消息傳遞想像為即將宣布下一個作業的老師。 老師可能會說（或廣播）“課，這是你今晚的作業”。 該消息針對班級（或子網）中的每個人，他們所有人都應該收到該消息。 \n \n \n \n The final method of data travel is called multicast. In multicast communication, data travels from a single device to multiple other devices on the network, but not necessarily to all of them, like it does when using broadcast communication. Also, this can expand outside of a single subnet. This works well when sharing a resource, such as streaming video. You can think of this type of communication as the Internet equivalent of watching satellite TV. For satellite TV, the signal is being sent out, but you have to “tune in” in order to receive (view) the data. \n 數據傳輸的最終方法稱為多播。 在多播通信中，數據從單個設備傳輸到網絡上的多個其他設備，但不一定要傳輸到所有其他設備，就像使用廣播通信時那樣。 而且，這可以擴展到單個子網之外。 在共享資源（例如流視頻）時，此方法效果很好。 您可以將這種類型的通信視為觀看衛星電視的互聯網。 對於衛星電視，正在發送信號，但是您必須“調入”才能接收（查看）數據。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'IPv4 Data Flows.html'}]};
