<p id="N10691" lang="">In this lesson, we will discuss TCP/IP, and the two common types of Internet addressing: Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6). We will discuss IPv4 in depth, as it is still the most dominant version in use in our networks. Then, we will cover the specifics of IPv6, differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and the reason we are moving toward IPv6 in the future.</p>
<p lang=""><span>在本課程中，我們將討論TCP / IP以及Internet尋址的兩種常見類型：Internet協議版本4（IPv4）和Internet協議版本6（IPv6）。我們將深入討論IPv4，因為它仍然是我們網絡中使用的最主要版本。然後，我們將介紹IPv6的細節，IPv4與IPv6之間的差異以及將來向IPv6過渡的原因。</span></p>

<p id="N1069E" lang="">Computer networks — including the Internet, which is the largest computer network — use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP for network communications both internally on a LAN/WAN and externally to the Internet.</p>
<p id="N106A1" lang="">TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity of data. TCP/IP specifies how data should be grouped, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination address. The TCP/IP model, along with many of its protocols, is maintained and managed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).</p>
<p id="N106A4" lang="">TCP/IP is one of two sets of protocols that collectively operate in the transport and network layers of the OSI model.</p>

<p id="N106B3" lang="">In addition to creating message segments and ensuring connectivity, some of the basic characteristics of the IP protocol ensure that datagrams are routed to the correct destination using a binary addressing scheme. While the process of how the IP addresses are derived from binary (and hexadecimal relationships) is not covered in this course, it is important to know that just as computer CPUs use binary numbers to process data, networking hardware and protocols do so as well.</p>
<p lang=""><span>計算機網絡（包括作為最大計算機網絡的Internet）使用傳輸控制協議/ Internet協議或TCP / IP進行內部LAN / WAN上和外部Internet的網絡通信。 TCP / IP提供數據的端到端連接。 TCP / IP指定如何在目標地址處對數據進行分組，尋址，傳輸，路由和接收。 TCP / IP模型及其許多協議由IETF（Internet工程任務組）維護和管理。 TCP / IP是在OSI模型的傳輸層和網絡層中共同運行的兩組協議之一。</span></p>

<p id="N106BF" lang="">Network devices require a logical address — either an IPv4 or IPv6 address (see the network layer in the diagram above) — when moving data from one network segment to another. As we discussed in previous modules, switches make their intelligent switching decisions (see the data link layer in the diagram above based on media access control (MAC) addresses. The MAC address, also known as the physical address, is the unique identifier hard coded on a network interface card by the manufacturer. Switches use these MAC addresses to identify which devices are on which switch ports, and forward traffic within the network segment to the correct ports based on these addresses. When data traffic needs to cross the boundaries of the network, it requires a logical address that the router can use to make intelligent routing decisions. In most modern networks, this is done by using TCP/IP addressing. Historically, other protocols existed, such as internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX) for Novell networks, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI for Microsoft networks. TCP/IP replaced these protocols almost exclusively due to its robust nature, reliability, and availability.</p>
<p id="N106C2" lang="">While the majority of our networks today still use IPv4, many networks are migrating to the newer IPv6 addressing standards. Additionally, many networks are offering dual support to both IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition. The reason for this transition is that we were running out of valid IPv4 addresses. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, providing only 4.2 billion available addresses, but IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme. IPv6 allows for 2<sup lang="">128</sup>addresses, or 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.4 x 10<sup lang="">38</sup>) unique IP addresses. IPv6 allows for more IP addresses than humanity could ever utilize. At least that is what we think right now.</p>
